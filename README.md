## 2-D physics engine

This project is an attempt on my part to make my first physics engine. I am writing it in python as I wanted to develope my skills in it. I am using pygame for the "physics engine loop" and assembling the GUI with pygame aswell.

#### Progress:
The gui is fully funcitioning a 1-D motion with an elastic bouncing particle works.

#### Current Working On:
Collision detection and real time physics calculations.
